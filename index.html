        <p class="Paragraph"><strong class="Test">Happy 12th Birthday</strong> my dearest cousin! <br><br>
        It was just yesterday that I remember our first cardboard boat sinking or the time we built that massive box fort and 
        all the other crazy adventures and ideas we brought to life every weekend. <br><br>

        Today I want to wish you a Happy Birthday and hope Allah grants you all your disires in life and accepts all your duas. I make dua to Allah
        to keep our bond as strong as it is and for us to continue doing the crazy stuff we do weather it be running from autumn or pulling what 
        we call mission impossible - If you know, you know. <br><br>

        But I hope you have an <strong>AWESOME DAY</strong>... <strong class="Test">Love you lots</strong>
        </p>
